# VanillaJS-Schematic-Designer
An advanced, feature-rich diagram editor built from the ground up with vanilla JavaScript to showcase complex UI development without relying on front-end frameworks. This project provides a complete creative suite, featuring an infinite, pannable, and zoomable canvas, a dynamic grid system with snapping, and intuitive controls for manipulating elements through direct interaction or a context-aware toolbar.  What sets this project apart is its integration of a powerful visual workflow system. Users can upload their own SVG components, draw custom shapes from scratch, and then assign and track tasks directly on these visual elements. Furthermore, the editor allows users to create persistent, adjustable connection lines between components, turning a static design into a dynamic planning tool.  Architected as a modular Single Page Application (SPA), the codebase leverages Object-Oriented principles for clarity and scalability. The project also includes simple, interchangeable backends in both Node.js (Express) and Python (Flask) to demonstrate full-stack integration for features like user authentication. This project serves as a comprehensive demonstration of advanced front-end engineering, state management, and architectural design patterns.
